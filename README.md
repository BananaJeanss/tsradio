# tsradio
a very very basic radio I made for [deltapage](https://github.com/BananaJeanss/deltapage) because i could not get icecast2 to work

## requirements

- `ffmpeg`
- that's pretty much it

## setup

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run build`
3. make a folder named playlist in the project root, and drop your mp3 files in there
4. copy .env.example and make any changes if wanted
5. `npm run start`
6. profit?
